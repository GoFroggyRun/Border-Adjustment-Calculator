# Border_Adjustment_Calculator
=================================

The code in this repo generates a 
[web-page](https://ospc.shinyapps.io/border-adjustment-calculator/) 
that illustrates how a border adjustment would affect a firm with $100 
in initial sales and other characteristics supplied by the user. Under full 
currency adjustment, the dollar appreciates by the same rate as the tax -- 
this effect is predicted by efficient market models. Under partial currency 
adjustments, firms may be able to pass on some of their increased import 
costs to consumers.  This model assumes that firms can fully deduct losses 
against past and future taxes.
